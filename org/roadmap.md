## Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PRs

-   [cncf/apisnoop/projects/ cncf/k8s-conformance gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/29)

### KR1 Setup prow.cncf.io

This repo is outside kubernetes org.

We'll need to set this up in a sustainable/supportable way.

-   [X] DNS prow.cncf.io pointing to prow.apisnoop.io
-   [X] Grant cncf-ci bot permissions to cncf github org
-   [X] Deploy clusters for prow.cncf.io
-   [X] Deploy prow onto said clusters
-   [ ] Researching the isolation / clusters used by test-infra / k8s-infra-wg
-   [ ] Look into setting up #wg-cncf-infra if there is interest

### KR2 Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io

Comments and admin actions from prow.cncf.io

Will be made using the [cncf-ci](https://github.com/cncf-ci) bot/github account.

-   [X] Enable [meow](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pull/971) and simple prow bot plugins

### KR3 gate+comment w/ list of unrun conformance tests

-   [ ] generate list of test run in a PR
-   [ ] generate list of tests required for PR version
-   [ ] comment with list of missing tests if under 20
-   [ ] comment with count of missing test if over 20
-   [ ] add hold tag if test lists don't match

-   definition

        Must confirm the set of tests being run matches...
        Must confirm that all behaviors are covered by a test...

## Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API

-   [k/k API+Conformance Gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30)

### Background

Influenced by [Behavior KEP user stories](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103) while continuing to focus on endpoints!

> Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.

> Comment: "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"

### OKing PR

> Existing responsiblity via owners file ensures that PRs touching swagger or conformance tests are ****/approved**** by right people.

> A label of ****requires-conformance**** will applied, and ****conformance**** label will need to be added by this gate + automation.

### KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review

PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

-   (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
-   [ ] Create `run_if_changed` presubmit

    eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
    eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance

### KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed

Tooling will compare `path/operation_id` in `api/openapi-spec/swagger.json`

-   [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints

### KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage

Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.

-   [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
-   [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints

### KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints

Tooling will comment directly on PR

-   [ ] alpha : endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] beta : endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] stable : comment+block via tag

### KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)

Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

-   [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
-   [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected

### KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch

-   [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
-   [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
-   [ ] Migration maybe in Q3

## Increase Stable Test Coverage by 40 endpoints

### KR1 (5/+40) new conformant stable endpoints

-   5 DONE

    -   +5 Merged [#89753](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89753)

-   X IN-PROGRESS

    -   +3 SOAK - Waiting for /approve

### KR2 +9% Coverage Increase 36.46%->45.46%

### KR3 (stretch +49) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
