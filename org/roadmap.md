# v1.19

Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in a stable, consistent way.

## April News

### prow.cncf.io

Connected to cncf/k8s-conformance!

### New [Timelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19#timeline) due to Covid:

The Conformance Subproject decided to set targets over k8s releases instead quarters.

These numbers are now targeted for over 1.19 instead of Q2.

These target in now 40 vs 9 in 1.18.

-   Tests need to be in Week 14 (July 16th)
-   Test Freeze Week 16 (July 30th)

### Tooling Requests blocked our existing Promotions +33

### 26 Endpoints decidedly NOT part of Conformance test

-   These Endpoints will not be part of Conformance
-   APISnoop has been updated this +1.77% increase in â€˜coverage

### Understanding when we gain or lose points

-   Coverage endpoints dropped due to [#90615](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90615)
-   k/k PR gate logic will help identify this in the future

### Process and Pipelines Much Cleaner

-   Conformance Board [ALL](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/9) / [ii](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/9?card_filter_query=author%3Ariaankl)
-   Riaan now manages the board

## Prepare to Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PRs

-   [cncf/apisnoop/projects/ cncf/k8s-conformance gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/29)

### KR1 Setup prow.cncf.io

This repo is outside kubernetes org.

We'll need to set this up in a sustainable/supportable way.

-   [X] DNS prow.cncf.io pointing to prow.apisnoop.io
-   [X] Grant cncf-ci bot permissions to cncf github org
-   [X] Deploy clusters for prow.cncf.io
-   [X] Deploy prow onto said clusters
-   [ ] Researching the isolation / clusters used by test-infra / k8s-infra-wg
-   [ ] Look into setting up #wg-cncf-infra if there is interest

### KR2 Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io

Comments and admin actions from prow.cncf.io

Will be made using the [cncf-ci](https://github.com/cncf-ci) bot/github account.

-   [ ] Enable meow and simple prow bot plugins

### KR3 gate+comment w/ list of unrun conformance tests

-   [ ] generate list of test run in a PR
-   [ ] generate list of tests required for PR version
-   [ ] comment with list of missing tests if under 20
-   [ ] comment with count of missing test if over 20
-   [ ] add hold tag if test lists don't match

        Must confirm that the version of the tests being run matches...
        Must confirm the set of tests being run matches...
        Must confirm that all behaviors are covered by a test...

## Prepare to Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API

-   [k/k API+Conformance Gate](https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30)

### Background

Influenced by [Behavior KEP user stories](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103) while continuing to focus on endpoints!

> Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.

> Comment: "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"

### OKing PR

> Existing responsiblity via owners file ensures that PRs touching swagger or conformance tests are ****/approved**** by right people.

> A label of ****requires-conformance**** will applied, and ****conformance**** label will need to be added by this gate + automation.

### KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review

PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

-   (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
-   [ ] Create `run_if_changed` presubmit

    eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
    eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance

### KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed

Tooling will compare `path/operation_id` in `api/openapi-spec/swagger.json`

-   [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints

### KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage

Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.

-   [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
-   [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
-   [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints

### KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints

Tooling will comment directly on PR

-   [ ] alpha : endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] beta : endpoints needing tests
-   [ ] stable : comment+block via tag

### KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)

Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

-   [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
-   [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected

### KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch

-   [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
-   [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
-   [ ] Migration maybe in Q3

## Increase Stable Test Coverage Velocity by 40 endpoints

### KR1 (5/+40) new conformant stable endpoints

-   5 DONE

    -   +5 Merged [#89753](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89753)

-   X IN-PROGRESS

    -   +3 SOAK - Waiting for /approve

### KR2 +9% Coverage Increase 36.46%->45.46%

### KR3 (stretch +49) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
