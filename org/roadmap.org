#+TITLE: APISnoop OKRs

* v1.19
Our goal is to not make radical changes to process or approach, but iterate on our working methods to increase velocity and output in  a stable, consistent way.
** News
*** Process and Pipelines Much Cleaner
- Conformance Board [[https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/9?card_filter_query=author%3Ariaankl][ALL]] / [[https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/9?card_filter_query=author%3Ariaankl][ii]]
- Riaan now manages the board
*** Tooling Requests blocked our existing Promotions
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90957][Watch Tooling]] -> 16
- [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90957][ReplicationController Tooling]] -> 7
*** 16 Endpoints decidedly NOT part of Conformance test
- These Endpoints will not be part of Conformance
- APISnoop has been updated this +3.6% increase in â€˜coverage
*** New [[https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.19#timeline][Timelines]] due to Covid:
Not effecting the velocity of ii

The group decided to set targets over relases VS quarters.
These numbers are now targeted for over 1.19 instead of Q2.

- Test need to be in Week 14 (July 16th)
- Test Freeze Week 16 (July 30th)
*** Understading when we gain or lose points
- which endpoints were taken away
- which endpoints were added
** Prepare to Gate cncf/k8s-conformance PRs
- [[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/29][cncf/apisnoop/projects/ cncf/k8s-conformance gate]]
*** KR1 Setup prow.cncf.io
This repo is outside kubernetes org.

We'll need to set this up in a sustainable/supportable way.
- [X] DNS prow.cncf.io pointing to prow.apisnoop.io
- [ ] Grant cncf-ci bot permissions to cncf github org
- [ ] Researching the isolation / clusters used by test-infra / k8s-infra-wg
- [ ] Deploy clusters for prow.cncf.io
- [ ] Deploy prow onto said clusters
- [ ] Look into setting up #wg-cncf-infra if there is interest
*** KR2 Connect cncf/k8s-conformance to prow.cncf.io
Comments and admin actions from prow.cncf.io

Will be made using the [[https://github.com/cncf-ci][cncf-ci]] bot/github account.
- [ ] Enable meow and simple prow bot plugins
*** KR3 gate+comment w/ list of unrun conformance tests
- [ ] generate list of test run in a PR
- [ ] generate list of tests required for PR version
- [ ] comment with list of missing tests if under 20
- [ ] comment with count of missing test if over 20
- [ ] add hold tag if test lists don't match

#+begin_example
Must confirm that the version of the tests being run matches...
Must confirm the set of tests being run matches...
Must confirm that all behaviors are covered by a test...
#+end_example

** Prepare to Gate k/k PRs touching test/e2e or API
- [[https://github.com/cncf/apisnoop/projects/30][k/k API+Conformance Gate]]

Influenced by [[https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1666/files?short_path=92a9412#diff-92a9412ae55358378bc66295cdbea103][Behavior KEP user stories]]

while continuing to focus on endpoints.

Will show increase in endpoints, and tested endpoints, but also, explicitly, whether conformance coverage increased.  Be able to say "you are adding a new endpoint to stable, and you are adding a conformance test for it"

We will investigate the method for ok'ing a pr, and who has the go-ahead to do this.  Bot would likely manage the approval, but done through labels applied by people in owners file or some other set convention.


*** KR1 Identify a PR as requiring conformance review
PR must touch file in conformance-specific directory

- (initially /area-conformance + /sig-arch)
- [ ] Create ~run_if_changed~ presubmit

#+begin_example
eg: update test/conformance/behaviors/..
eg: mv from test/e2e to test/conformance
#+end_example
*** KR2 Identify list of endpoints added/removed
Tooling will compare ~path/operation_id~ in ~api/openapi-spec/swagger.json~
- [ ] Generate list of new endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of removed endpoints
*** KR3 Run APISnoop against PR to generate endpoint coverage
Tooling will provide a list of tested and conformant endpoints.
- [ ] Wait for main prow job to finish
- [ ] Generate list of hit/tested endpoints
- [ ] Generate list of conformant endpoints
*** KR4 bot comment w/ list of increase/decrease of endpoints
Tooling will comment directly on PR

- [ ] alpha : comment endpoints needing tests
- [ ] beta : comment endpoints needing tests
- [ ] stable : comment and block via tag
*** KR5 Manual Approval for SIG-Arch (or appropriate owners)
Ensure the API Review process has been followed.

- [ ] Get feedback on approval process from SIG-Arch
- [ ] Ensure the correct tagging / OWNERS are respected
*** KR6 Donate APISnoop to sig-arch
- [ ] Get feedback if this is desired
- [ ] Get as to location of repo under k8s org
- [ ] Migration maybe in Q3
** Increase Stable Test Coverage Velocity 50% over 1.18
*** KR1 (20/+40) new conformant stable endpoints
**** 20 DONE
- +4 Merged
- +16 Denominator Points Removed
**** X IN-PROGRESS
- +3 SOAK
*** KR2 +9% Coverage Increase
*** KR3 (stretch) 50% stable endpoints hit by conformance tests
